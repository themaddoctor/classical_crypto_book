# If you are wondering why all.pdf is no longer here, it is because I had to correct a formula in part 3. The full PDF is a whopping 5MB in size, and GitHub will not upload it without timing out. I tried at least 20 times, and now I give up. So you lose. Try using pdfjam (comes with TeTeX) or pdfshuffler (runs on Python, so you can get your non-linux system to run it) to put the pieces together. If the file reappears in the future, it's because I hate myself and spent another hour trying to upload it.
